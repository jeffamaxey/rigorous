General overview of changes:

An extra step has been added between surface syntax and core syntax which we call lexical syntax.
The purpose of the conversion from surface to lexical syntax is to modify the user program into
one which is completely lexically scoped in the usual sense of this term. This means that all
variables at each scope level are hoisted to the top of the level using let statements. This
includes all global variables as well. Nonlocal variables do not exist after this step. Any
variables declared as nonlocal simply are not used in a new let statement so that they are not
shadowed. After being transformed into lexical syntax, one can be assured that all variables
in the program are introduced through let statements and that all assignments are strictly
mutative. The conversion from lexical to core syntax is almost identical to the old conversion
from surface to lexical syntax.

In addition, the lexical stage converts instance variables from being defined in class bodies to
being field assignments. That is (with some details omitted),

  class A:
    def a(self):
      pass

becomes

  A = CClass "A"
  A.a = CFunc (self) pass

in lexical syntax. This change and the necessity for variables to be introduced via let statements
led to a ton of refactoring of library functions and builtin objects, including how these are
introduced into the program. None of these changes should affect anyone's code, but be aware of
if you need to alter/add funtionality to library functions or builtins.


Changes to core syntax:
- Added CContinue variant to CExpr
- Added Continue variant to Result
- Added VPointer variant to CVal (for aliasing)
- Removed env from all Result variants
- Added (optionof Address) to v*s and Return Results (for aliasing)
  - When a value is created to be passed up the chain of execution, an Address location
    can optionally be added to indicate that the value exists at a location in the store.
    This information can be used during assignment to determine if an alias (VPointer)
    should be created or if a copy should be made.
- Added an IdType field to CLet


Changes to lex syntax:
- Added all of it
  - Basic correspondence with surface syntax except globals/nonlocals are removed and all
    identifiers are introduced using Lex(Global|Local)Let with LexAssign always being mutative.
- Added LexContinue


Changes to surface syntax:
- Added PyContinue


Function/helper changes:
- Changed mk-exception in python-interp to create a VObject from scratch instead of
  interping an application of the class to create it. Therefore, calls to the function no
  longer require an environment.
- All assignments to variables are mutative


Bugs fixed:
- __class__ and __dict__ should now exist and be readable for all classes.

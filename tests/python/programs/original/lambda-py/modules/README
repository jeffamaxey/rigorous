# module and package test

Currently those cases test the following features:

 - the import form with `from` and without `from`
 - the import form with `as`
 - the correctness of imported modules
 - the scope of modules
 - import execution step
   - imported module should be added to `sys.modules`
   - importing module with errors should not be added to `sys.modules`
- the sys.meta_path feature
